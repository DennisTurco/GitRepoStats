# Configuration for Repository Analysis
# These options control how the tool analyzes code, duplication,

CodeOwnership:
  # List of file extensions to exclude from code ownership (e.g., binary or image files)
  ExcludeFiles:
    - .png
    - .svg
    - .jpg
    - .jpeg
    - .gif
    - .exe
    - .dll
    - .so
    - .log
    - .ico

  # If the total number of authors is less than this threshold,
  # all authors will be shown (even if they contributed 0%)
  ShowZeroPercentAuthorsIfLessThan: 5


CodeDuplication:
  # Similarity threshold for considering two functions as duplicates.
  # Lower values â†’ more sensitive detection (may include false positives).
  Threshold: 5.0

  # How many neighboring functions to compare for duplication.
  # Higher = slower but more thorough.
  WindowSize: 5

  # Maximum allowed Hamming distance between pre-hashed functions.
  # Higher = allows more dissimilar hashes to be compared.
  MaxHammingDiff: 10

  # Maximum allowed difference in number of lines of code (NLOC) between two functions.
  # Higher = allows comparison between functions of different lengths.
  MaxNlocDiff: 100


CodeComplexity:
  # File extensions to exclude from code complexity analysis.
  # Useful for ignoring non-core or third-party code.
  ExcludeExtensions:
    - js
    - json

  # Function names to exclude from analysis (e.g., auto-generated or anonymous).
  ExcludeFunctions:
    - "(anonymous)"
    - ""
