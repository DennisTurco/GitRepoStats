  # If the total number of authors is less than this threshold,

  ShowZeroPercentAuthorsIfLessThan: 5


CodeDuplication:
  # Similarity threshold for considering two functions as duplicates.
  # Lower values → more sensitive detection (may include false positives).
  Threshold: 5.0

  # How many neighboring functions to compare for duplication.
  # Higher = slower but more thorough.
  WindowSize: 5

  # Maximum allowed Hamming distance between pre-hashed functions.
  # Higher = allows more dissimilar hashes to be compared.
  MaxHammingDiff: 10

  # Maximum allowed difference in number of lines of code (NLOC) between two functions.
  # Higher = allows comparison between functions of different lengths.
  MaxNlocDiff: 100


CodeComplexity:
  # File extensions to exclude from code complexity analysis.
  # Useful for ignoring non-core or third-party code.
  ExcludeExtensions:

  # Function names to exclude from analysis (e.g., auto-generated or anonymous).
